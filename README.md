## Based on: Chili's "C++ 3D DirectX Programming" Tutorial Series
Huge thanks to the original author as this project wouldn't be possible without this tutorial series.

## Usage 
No usage for now, I don't really see a point of releasing and unfinished engine.
Usage will probably be added when it's complete.

## Motivation
The motivation behind creating this was to help me understand GPU pipelining and familiarize with the overall schematics of low-level GPU Programming.
